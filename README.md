# Churn Prediction and Power BI Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques and visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, identify key factors influencing churn, and develop a predictive model to help businesses retain customers. Additionally, SQL was used to compute Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for better insights.

## üìä Features
- **Churn Prediction Model**: A machine learning model trained to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical and visual analysis of customer data to uncover patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selection and transformation of relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of different machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
- **SQL for KPI Calculation**: SQL queries were used to calculate key metrics such as churn rate, total customers, and service-based churn.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard providing visual insights into churn trends and customer behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building and evaluating the machine learning model.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **SQL**: For computing KPIs and extracting insights from the database.
- **Power BI**: For creating an interactive dashboard to display insights.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project hosting.

## üìà Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides insights into various aspects of customer churn, including:
- **Total Churn by Gender**: Visualizes the number of churned customers based on gender.
- **Total Customers and Churn Rate by Age Group**: Analyzes customer distribution and churn rate across different age categories.
- **Churn Rate by Payment Method**: Compares churn rates among various payment methods used by customers.
- **Churn Rate by Contract Type**: Examines the impact of contract types on customer retention.
- **Total Customers and Churn Rate by Tenure Group**: Assesses how customer tenure influences churn probability.
- **Churn Rate by State**: Displays churn distribution across different geographical locations.
- **Total Churn by Category**: Breaks down churn data based on customer categories.
- **Churn Rate by Internet Type**: Highlights how different internet services contribute to churn.
- **Churn by Service**: Analyzes churn rates based on subscribed services.
- **Churn Reasons Table**: Presents a detailed overview of the primary reasons customers choose to leave.

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks to explore data and train the model.
4. Execute the SQL scripts in the sql to compute KPIs.
5. Open the Power BI dashboard (.pbix file) to interactively analyze churn insights.

## üìå Results & Insights
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
Key factors influencing churn include **Service based**, **Contract** and **Payment Method**.

## üì¢ Future Improvements
1. Enhancing feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
2. Integrating real-time data updates into Power BI for live monitoring.
3. Deploying the model as an API for real-world applications.
